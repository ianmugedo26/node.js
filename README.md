# Learn Node.js — Aneeqa Khan’s Dev.to Series

This repository tracks my progress following the **Learn Node.js** series on *DEV Community* by **Aneeqa Khan**. These articles cover core backend development skills using Node.js, REST APIs, MongoDB, authentication, JWT, middleware, and more — all oriented toward beginners. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📌 Series Overview

The articles in this series guide you through building backend applications with Node.js and teach fundamental concepts such as setting up a server, building REST APIs, working with databases, routing, error handling, and implementing authentication. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

2. **Creating REST API Routes in Node.js** – Defining routes and handling HTTP requests. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
3. **Setup Error Middleware and Async Handler** – Centralizing error management and async handlers. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
4. **Create MongoDB Database and Connect with Mongoose** – Connecting Node apps to MongoDB using Mongoose. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
5. **GET, POST, PUT and DELETE Todos from the Database** – CRUD operations with MongoDB. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
6. **How to Create User Routes in Node.js** – Structuring user-specific routes. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
7. **Building Secure User Registration and Authentication** – User signup/login workflows. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
8. **Crafting a Secure Auth System with JWT and Middleware** – Implementing JWT authentication. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## 🛠 What You’ll Learn

Following this series will help you:

- 📦 Configure a Node.js server using Express. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- 🔌 Build RESTful API endpoints. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- 🛠 Handle errors and asynchronous logic gracefully. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- 🗄️ Integrate MongoDB using Mongoose. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- 🧠 Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- 🧑‍💻 Create user authentication and protected routes using JWT. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

---

## 🚀 Recommended Project Structure

- **controllers/** — Business logic functions.  
- **routes/** — API route definitions.  
- **middleware/** — Error handlers, auth middleware, etc.  
- **models/** — Mongoose models.  
- **server.js** — Entry point that starts the server.  
- **app.js** — Configures Express, middleware, and routes.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries You’ll Use

- **Node.js** – Backend runtime.  
- **Express.js** – Web framework for routing and middleware.  
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** – Database and object modeling.  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** – Authentication.  
- **Nodemon** – Auto-reloads server during development.

---

## 📚 Tips for Learning

- Start by reading each article and *implementing the code yourself*.  
- Test each route using tools like **Postman** or **Insomnia**.  
- Take notes on why middleware or JWT flows work the way they do — that’s where real understanding happens.

---

## 🧩 Further Resources

Once you’ve finished this series you should consider diving into:

- Advanced Express patterns and folder structure.
- Building full REST APIs with pagination, filters, and sorting.
- Authentication and authorization strategies.  
- Testing Node.js applications with Jest/Supertest.
